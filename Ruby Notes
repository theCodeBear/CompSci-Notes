Ruby Notes


Ruby is interpreted. Ruby is a server-side scripting language simliar to Python and Perl.
Ruby can be embedded into HTML.
Ruby supports GUI tools such as Tcl/Tk, GTC, and OpenGL.
Ruby is considered a perfect OOP language.


************************ GENERAL RUBY NOTES ************************

irb:
    You can type irb into the command line to bring up the Interactive Ruby (IRb), which is the
    Ruby shell for Ruby experimentation.

All Ruby files have the following file extension:       .rb

For linux at the beginning of the source code put:      #!/usr/bin/ruby -w

The "-w" option enables warnings to be used when whitespace is sometimes used to interpret ambiguous
statements. Normally whitespace is ignored in Ruby code though.
        i.e.    a + b is interpreted as a+b <-- a local variable
                a  +b is interpreted as a(+b) <-- a method call

Run programs on the command line like so:              ruby filename.rb




************************ GENERAL SYNTAX ************************


Line Endings:
    Ruby interprets semi-colons and newline characters (by newline characters this means nothing
    at the end of a statement) as the ending of a statement.
    If Ruby encounters operators, like +,-, or \ at the end of a line it acts as a continuation
    character to continue the statement onto the next line.


Comments:
    Use # for comments.
    Like other scripting languages, # works the same way that // works in C++

    Create a block comment as follows, using =begin and =end:

        =begin
        This is a block comment
        And it is three whole
        lines
        long!
        =end


Ruby identifiers/keywords are case sensitive.

Ruby keywords:
    BEGIN
    END
    alias
    and
    begin
    break
    case
    class
    def
    defined?
    do
    else
    elsif
    end
    ensure
    false
    for
    if
    in
    module
    next
    nil
    not
    or
    redo
    rescue
    retry
    return
    self
    super
    then
    true
    undef
    unless
    until
    when
    while
    __FILE__
    __LINE__


Here Document:
    Basically a Here Document is a way to build strings that are multiple lines. You create it by
    using a << followed immediately by either a string literal or an identifier used to terminate
    the here document (the multi-line string). All the lines following the line with <<, up to the
    terminator, are the value of the string.

    The terminator, if used, can be without quotes or with quotes, and if with quotes then the type
    of quotes matters. Double quotes is the same as not using quotes, and this just creates a string
    literal. But single quotes treats the multi-line string as Ruby code commands to execute.

    i.e.
            print <<EOF
                This is the first line of a here document multi-line string,
                and this is the second.
            EOF

            print <<"EOF"
                This is the same as the above here document
                because double-quotes is same as no quotes around terminator.

            print <<'EOC'
                echo this will print out everything but echo
                echo because echo is a keyword to print like in php.
            EOC

            print <<"firstTerminator", <<"secondTerminator"
                This will print out for the first here document.
            firstTerminator
                This will print out for the second here document.
            secondTerminator


BEGIN:
    Syntax:     BEGIN {
                    code...
                }

    The BEGIN keyword is used to contain the code that will be run before the program is run.

    i.e.
            #!/usr/bin/ruby
            puts "this is the main program"
            BEGIN {
                puts "Initializing the Ruby program"
            }

END:
    Syntax:     END {
                    code...
                }

    The END keyword declares code to be called at the end of the program.
    i.e.
            #!/usr/bin/ruby
            puts "This is the main program"
            END {
                puts "Terminating the program"
            }
            BEGIN {
                puts "Initializing the program"
            }




************************ CLASSES AND OBJECTS ************************


To define a class in Ruby start with the "class" keyword, then the class name which should have an
uppercase first letter, and you end a class definition with the "end" keyword.

Syntax:     class MyClass
                # class definition...
            end

Ruby has four types of variables:
    Local variables - defined in a method. Starts with a lowercase letter or underscore.
    Instance variables - available across any methods in an object (normal member variables of
                         objects). Use the @ sign to refer to an instance variable
    Class variables - available across all objects of a class. Use @@ to refer to a call variable.
    Global variables - available across all classes, so available anywhere in the program. Use the
                       $ sign to refer to a global variable.

Creating Objects:
    Use the "new" method of a class to create an object of that class.
    i.e.
            myObj = MyClass.new

    You can create a constructor to pass arguments through the "new" method to the object by using
    the "initialize" method in the class definition. You define methods using the "def" keyword, and
    ending the method with the "end" keyword.
    i.e.
            class MyClass
                def initialize(var1, var2, var3)        # these are local variables
                    @var1 = var1                        # these are instance variables
                    @var2 = var2
                    @var3 = var3
                end
            end

            myObj = MyClass.new("blah", 43, "bloop")    # creates new object using constructor above

Member Methods:
    In Ruby functions are called methods. Each method in a class starts with the "def" keyword and
    ends with the "end" keyword. Method names should be lowercase.
    
    i.e. (method to go inside a class)
                                            def function
                                                # code...
                                            end

    Note that if a method has no parameters you don't even need to include the paranetheses.




************************ VARIABLES ************************


There are five kinds of variables in Ruby.

Also mentioned some stuff about variables in the above section.

NOTE:   You can access the value of any variable or constant, regardless of scope, by putting a
        hash (#) character just before it.

Global variables begin with $. Uninitialized global variables have the value nil and produce
warnings with the -w option. It is no recommended to use global variables.
        i.e.        $globalVar

Instance variables are member variables of an object. Initialized with a @ before the variables
name. Uninitialized global variables have the value nil and produce
warnings with the -w option.
        i.e.        @instanceVar

Class variables begin with @@. They are shared among all objects and descendents of that class. An example would be a counter that keeps track of how many times that class, and its descendents, have
been instantiated. Overriding class variables produce warnings with the -w option.
        i.e.        @@classVar

Local variables have no special character to begin with, just a lowercase letter or underscore.
These variables are local to the method, class module, or block from which they originate. When an
uninitialized local variable is referenced it is interpreted as a call to a method that has no
arguments. Assignment to unitialized local variables also serves as variable declaration, so they
have the scope of where they were initialized from.
        i.e.        localVar

Constants start with an uppercase letter (and generally are entirely uppercase). They can be declared
outside a class or module and have global scope, or inside a class or module and have that scope.
Constants cannot be defined within methods. Referencing an uninitialized constant produces an error,
and making an assignment to a constant that is already initialized produces a warning.
        i.e.        CONSTANT


Pseudo-Variables:
    These are special variables that have the appearance of local variables but behave like
    constants. You cannot assign any value to these variables. They are as follows:
            self    -   the receiver object of the current method
            true    -   value representing true
            false   -   value representing false
            nil     -   value representing undefined (null)
            __FILE__    -   the name of the current source file
            __LINE__    -   the current line number in the source file


Variable Data Types (Literals):

    Integer Numbers:
        An integer can range in size from -2^30 to (2^30)-1 or -2^62 to (2^62)-1. Integers in these
        ranges are objects of the class "Fixnum". Integers outside this range are stored in objects
        of the class "Bignum".
        use 0 to start an octal number, 0x to start a hex number, or 0b to start a binary number.
        Underscore characters can be written into the integer as they are ignored.
        Can get the integer value for an ASCII number or escape sequence by preceding the number
        with a question mark:
                                    ?a          ?\n

    Floating-Point Numbers:
        Floating-Point numbers are objects of the class "Float" and can take the following forms:
                123.4               # normal decimal
                1.2e9               # scientific notation
                4E9                 # scientific notation (don't need a dot and decimal place)
                5e+20               # sign (pos or neg) before exponential

    String Literals:
        String literals are objects of the "String" class. Double-quoted strings allow substitution
        and backslash (escape sequence) notation, but single-quoted strings don't allow substitution
        and only allow backslash (escape sequence) notation for \\ and \'.
                i.e.            puts 'escape using "\\"'        # output:   escape using "\""
                                puts 'That\'s right'            # output:   That's right
        To substitute the value of any Ruby expression into a string use the following format:
                #{expr}
            i.e.
                puts "Value: #{11.4*150}"

    Escape Characters:
        \n
        \r          -   carriage return
        \f          -   form feed
        \b          -   backspace
        \a          -   alert
        \e          -   escape
        \s          -   space
        \nnn        -   octal notation
        \xnn        -   hex notation
        \cx, \C-x   -   Control-x
        \M-x        -   Meta-x
        \M-\C-x     -   Meta-Control-x
        \x          -   Character x

    Arrays:
        An array in Ruby can hold values of different data types. Create an array with a
        comma-separated series of object references (remember everything is an object so all values
        and variable types are objects) between square brackets. A trailing comma is ignored.

        i.e.
                myArray = ["todd", 20, "Blah", 'yo', 2.17]

    Hashes:
        A literal Hash is created by placing a list of key/value pairs between curly braces, with
        either a comma or the sequence => between they key and value. A trailing comma is ignored.
            i.e.
                    myHash = {"todd" => 30, "Deep" => "baby", "Bryce" => "flake", "Pi" => 3.14}

    Ranges:
        A range represents an interval of a set of values with a start and an end. Ranges may be
        constructed using the s..e and s...e literals, or with Range.new.
        Ranges constructed with ".." run from the start to the end inclusively, while using "..."
        excludes the end value. Range.new() is the same as using "..", so inclusive. When used as an
        iterator, ranges return each value in the sequence.
            i.e.
                    1..4                # range is 1,2,3,4
                    1...4               # range is 1,2,3
                    Range.new(1,4)      # range is 1,2,3,4




************************ OPERATORS ************************


Most operators in Ruby are actually method calls (a + b is interpreted as a.+(b), where the + method
is called by "a" with argument "b".).

For every operator there is a corresonding form of abbreviated assignment operator (i.e. +=).

Arithmetic operators:
                        +   -   *   /   %   **

Comparison operators:
                        ==      !=      >       <       >=      <=

                        <==>        # combines comparison operator, returns 0 if first operand equals
                                      the second, returns 1 if first operand is greater than the
                                      second, returns -1 if first operand is less than the second.
                        ===         # used to test equality within a "when" cluase of a case
                                      statement.        i.e.        (1...10) === 5     returns true
                        .eql?       # true if receiver and argument have both the same type and
                                      equal values (so like === in some other languages).
                                      i.e.      1.eql?(1.0)    returns false
                        .equal?     # true if receiver and argument have the same object id, so must
                                      be not just an equal object but actually the same object to
                                      be true.
                                      i.e.   if aObj is a duplicate of bObj then aObj==bObj, while
                                             aObj.equal?bObj is false but aObj.equal?aObj is true.

Assignment operators: 
                        =   +=  -=  *=  /=  %=  **=  |=  &=  >>=  <<=  &&=  ||=  {

Parallel Assignment:
    Ruby supports the parallel assignment of variables, which means multiple variables can be
    initialized on a single line.
        i.e.            a, b, c = 10, 20, 30
        i.e.            a, b = b, c

Bitwise operators:
    Works on bits and performs bit by bit operations.
        &   -   and
        |   -   or
        ^   -   xor
        ~   -   one's complement, is unary and has the effect of flipping the bits. i.e. (~60) = -61
        <<  -   binary left shift, the left operands values is moved by the number of bits specified
                in the right operand.           i.e.    60 << 2 will give 240  (1111 0000)
        >>  -   binary right shift, works the same as the binary left shift operator, but opposite.

Logical operators:
    and &&      or ||       not !               # can use either version of each operator

    NOTE:   There is a difference between "and" and &&, as well as between "or" and ||.
            See the following website for what the difference is:
                    http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1426826/difference-between-and-and-in-ruby

Ternary operator:
    The ternary operator is a short hand for an if-else statement. Operator is "? :"
    i.e.        (x == 10) ? x++ : x--       equivalent to:      if (x==10)
                                                                    x++
                                                                else
                                                                    x--

Range operators:
    Sequence ranges in Ruby are used to create a range of successive values consisting of a start
    value, and end value, and a range of values in between.
    The operators, mentioned above in the Variables section are;
        ..      -   creates an inclusive range
        ...     -   creates a range inclusive of start value but exclusive of end value

defined? operators:
    defined? is a special operator that takes the form of a method call to determine whether or not
    the passed expression is defined. It returns a description string of the expression, or nil if
    the expression isn't defined.
    
        Syntax:     defined? variable           # true if variable is initialized

        i.e.    foo = 43
                defined? foo            # returns "local-variable"
                defined? $_             # returns "global-variable"
                defined? bar            # returns nil if undefined

        
        Syntax:     defined? method_call    # true if method is defined

        i.e.    defined? puts           # returns "method"
                defined? puts(bar)      # nil if bar is undefined
                defined? unpack         # nil is unpack is undefined


        Syntax:     defined? super      # true if a method exists that can be called with super user

        i.e.    defined? super      # "super" if it can be called
                defined? super      # "nil" if it cannot be called


        Syntax:     defined? yield          # true if a code black has been passed

        i.e.    defined? yield      # "yield" if there is a block passed
                defined? yield      # "nil" if there is no block


Dot and Double Colon operators:
    Use the Dot operator to call a module method (like most languages), and you can reference a
    constantusing the module name and two colons.
    
    The :: is a unary operator that allows constants, instance methods, and class methods defined
    within a class or module to be accessed from anywhere outside the class or module.
    Remember, in Ruby classes and methods may be considered constants too.

    You can prefix the :: operator with an expression that returns the appropriate class or module
    object, or if you don't use any prefix for it then the main Object class is used by default.

    i.e.
            ::CONST = 1

            ClassName::CONST = 1            # if the constant is in the class "ClassName"


More operators:
    [][]=           element reference, element set
    =~
    !~




************************ CONDITIONALS ************************


The three conditional are:  if-elsif-else
                            unless-else
                            case-when-else

"if" and "unless" can be used as modifiers in the middle of a line of code as well. 

if-statement:
    In an if-statement, the values "false" and "nil" are false, everything else is true.
    At the end of the line of code with the "if" you can either put a semi-colon, the "then" keyword,
    or nothing.
    Note that the else-if statement in Ruby is:     elsif
    Note also that you don't need parentheses around the condition.

        if condition
            # code...
        elsif condition
            # code...
        else
            # code...
        end


The "if" Modifier:
    You can write an if-condition at the end of some code line.

        Syntax:     code if condition
        i.e.        puts "todd is great" if x > 30


The "unless" statement:
    The "unless" statement is the opposite of the if-statement. It executes a block of code if the
    condition is false, and if the condition is true then it executes the code in the block
    statement. All the same syntax rules apply to the "unless" statement that apply to if-statements.
    Although I don't think there is a elsif equivalent for the unless-statement.

    Syntax:         unless conditional
                        # code...
                    else
                        # code...
                    end

The "unless" Modifier:
    Just like with "if", you can use "unless" at the end of some code.

        Syntax:     code unless condition
        i.e.        puts "todd is great" unless x < 30

The "case" statement:
    Compares the expression specified by case against the expressions in the "when" statements.
    The comparison between the case expression and the 'when' expressions uses a hidden === sign.
    Just like with if and unless statements, the case and when statements can be ended with a
    semi-colon, the keyword "then", or nothing (just an endline). Use the else statement as the
    equivalent of default for switch statements in other languages. Putting a comma between values
    in the when-statement creates an OR operator so you can test against multiple values, for a
    given block to execute.
    You can use ranges as the expressions, like 1..5
    You can separate the When condition from the code the "then" keyword, nothing (a newline), or
    either a semi-colon or colon - I'm not sure, it's either one of these or both.

    Syntax:     case exp1
                    when exp2, exp3
                        # code...
                    when exp4
                        # code...
                    else
                        # code...
                    end




************************ LOOPS ************************


Ruby has the following loops:   while
                                for
                                until
                                redo
                                entry

Also the following loops can be used as modifiers occuring in the middle of a line of code:
        while

Just like with conditional statements, notice that loop in Ruby don't use parentheses around
conditions.

While-loop:
    A while-conditional line can end with either a semi-colon, backslash, the keyword "do", or
    nothing (just and endline).

    Syntax:     while condition
                    # code...
                end

While Modifier:
    Syntax:         code while condition        or use          begin
                                                                    # code...
                                                                end while condition

    If used in the "code while condition" format it executes as a normal while-loop, that is it
    checks the condition first. If using the "begin" keyword with while (with no rescue or ensure
    clauses) it creates the equivalent to a do-while loop.


Until-loop:
    The opposite of a while-loop, equivalent to an "unless" version of the while-loop.
    executes code while the condition is false.
    Same syntax rules that apply to a while-loop apply to an until-loop, except in an until-loop
    you cannot end the conditional line of code with a backslash.

    Syntax:     until condition
                    # code...
                end

Until Modifier:
    Syntax:         code unless condition       or use          begin
                                                                    # code...
                                                                end until condition

    Just like with the 'while' modifier, if using the 'begin' keyword with the until-modifier, if
    it doesn't include a rescue or ensure clause then it acts as a do-until loop where the code
    executes once before checking the condition.


For-loop:
    There is no standard tri-statement for-loop in Ruby.
    The only for-loop in ruby is a for-in loop. You set a variable (or multiple variables separated
    by commas) to iterate over a range or some set of values.

    You can end the conditional statement in the for-loop with a semi-colon, the "do" keyword, or
    nothing (just an endline).

    Syntax:     for variable[,variable...] expression
                    # code...
                end

    i.e.        for i in 0..5
                    puts "Value of local variable is #{i}"
                end


Each-do:
    ".each do" is almost the same as a for-in loop, except that a for-loop doesn't create a new
    scope for local variables.
    "each" operates on an expression using the dot operator, and then "do" specifies the variable(s)
    to use to iterate through the expression, as well as the code to be executed for each element of
    the expression (which could be a range or a set of elements of some sort). Around the variable
    is a single pipebar on each side

    Syntax:     (expression).each do |variable(s)|
                    # code...
                end

    i.e.        (0..5).each do |i|
                    puts "Value of local variable is #{i}"
                end

break:
    The break keyword terminates the innermost loop. It can also be used to terminate a method with
    an associated block if called within the block (which makes the method return nil).

next:
    The next keyword jumps to the next iteration of the innermost loop. Also can be used to terminate
    the execution of a block if called within the block (with "yield" or "call" returning nil).

redo:
    The redo keyword restarts the iteration of the innermost loop, without checking the loop
    condition. If called within a block it restarts "yield" or "call".

retry:
    When retry keyword appears in the rescue clause of a "begin" expression. It restarts from the
    beginning of the "begin" body. See rescue explanation below.
    If retry appears in the iterator, the block, or the body of the for-loop, it restars the
    invocation of the iterator call, and the argument to the iterator is re-evaluated.

    i.e.        for i in 0...5
                    retry if condition          # restrarts from i == 0

rescue:
    The rescue keyword I guess handles errors. The begin-rescue block is like a try-catch block.

    Syntax for using rescue and retry:
            begin
                # code...                   # exception raised
            rescue
                # code to handle error
                retry                       # restarts from beginning
            end




************************ METHODS ************************


Method names should begin with a lowercase letter.

Use the "def" keyword to define a method.
If there are no parameters you don't include any parentheses.
You can give a parameter a default value (in case when it is called an argument is not given) by
simply assigning a value in the parameter list with the equal sign.
As with all other blocks of code in Ruby, end the method definition with the "end" keyword.

Syntax:
            def methodName                  def methodName(param1, param2, param3=default)
                # code...
            end


Calling a method:
    To call a method you simply write the name of the function if there are no arguments given, or
    with arguments you just write the arguments separated by commas and that's it, no parantheses
    are used.

    Syntax:     methodName arg1, arg2


Return values:
    Every method in Ruby returns a value by default. The return value is the value of the last
    statement in the method definition.

    Or you can use the "return" keyword to return one or more values. If more than one value is
    returned then separate the values with commas. If more than two (one?) values are given in the
    return statement then an array containing these values will be returned. If the return statement
    is not followed by any values then it returns nil.

    Syntax:     return              return value1           return value1, value2, value3


Variable Number of Parameters:
    You can put one parameter with a * in front of it to specify that parameter to be a variable
    parameter, meaning it can take multiple values. Basically I guess it just makes an array in the
    parameter list that takes all the arguments.

    Syntax:         def methodname(*param)
                        # code...
                    end


Class Methods:
    When a method is defined outside of the class definition, the method is marked as private by
    default, whereas the methods defined in a class are public by default. The default visibility
    and the private mark of the methods can be changed by "public" or "private" of the Module.??

    Normally to access a class method you must instantiate an object of that class first and then
    call the method on the object, but Ruby give a way to access a method without instantiating
    a class. You do this by simply calling the method on the class name itself, instead of an
    object.

    To define a class method:
                                    class MyClass
                                        def someMeth
                                        end
                                    end

    To call a method:
            i.e.                objName.someMeth            or      MyClass.someMeth


Aliases:
    You can give an alias to methods or global variables. Aliases cannot be defined within the
    method body. The alias of the method keeps the current definition of the method, even when
    methods are overridden.
    Making aliases for numbered global variables ($1, $2, etc) is prohibited because they are
    built-in global variables. Overriding the built-in global variables may cause serious problems.

        Syntax:         alias theAliasName methodName
                        alias $theAliasName $globalVarName


Undef:
    The "undef" keyword cancels the method definition. An "undef" cannot appear in the method body.
    By using undef and alias, the interface of the class can be modified independently from the
    superclass, but I think maybe it can break a program by the internal method call to "self".

        Syntax:     undef methodName


Using &,* Prefixes for Parameters and Arguments:
    If both * and & are used in a parameter list, the & should come at the end, in fact, the &param
    should always be the last parameter in the list.

    &:
        Put an & in front of the parameter name that expects a block in the parameter list in the
        definition of the method.

            i.e.    def myMeth(blah, &theblock) ... end

        When & is put before an argument name when calling a method it is used give a Proc object
        as an actual block defined in the argument list.

            i.e.    def myMeth(&Proc.new{ block code })

    *:
        Put an * in front of a parameter name in order to combine all of the remaining arguments
        into a single list.

            i.e.    def myMeth(*a) ... end
                    myMeth(1,2,3)                   # 1,2,3 all go into the 'a' Array

        When * is put before an argument when calling a method it is used to expand an array in the
        argument list so that each element of the array goes into a different parameter.

            i.e.    def myMeth(a,b,c,d) ... end
                    myMeth(1, *[5,6,7])                 # parameters will be: a=1, b=5, c=6, d=7




************************ BLOCKS ************************


A block consists of chunks of code.
You assign a name to a block.
The code in a block is always enclosed with curly braces { }
A block is always invoked from a method with the same name as the block.
You involve a block by using the yield statement.
A block can have parameters, and so a yield statement can take arguments.
You can also pass a block as an argument to a method.

Syntax:
            blockName { |param1, param2|
                # code...
            }

Yield:
    Yield can have zero or more parameters.
    Syntax:     yield arg1, arg2...
    
    i.e.
            def test
                puts "You are in the method"
                yield
                puts "You are again back to the method"
                yield
            end
            test {
                puts "You are in the block"
            }

Parameters are syntactically similar to thos used in and each-do statement, in that you put them
between pipe bars:      |params|
Multiple parameters will be comma separated, but between the same pair of pipe bars.

    i.e.
            def test
                yield 5
                puts "You are in the method"
                yield 100
            end
            test { |i|
                puts "You are in the block #{i}"
            }


Passing blocks to methods:
    By putting an "&" sign at the beginning of the last parameter in a method (note that it must be
    the last parameter in the parameter list) you can designate that parameter to take a block.
    If both a * and an & are used in the argument list the & should come later.

    To call a block from the parameter list use:        blockname.call

    Syntax:
            def test(&block)
                block.call
            end
            test {
                # code...
            }


BEGIN and END blocks:
    Every Ruby source code file can declare blocks of codeto be run as the file is being loaded and
    after the program has finished executing. The BEGIN block runs as the file is being loaded, the
    END block runs after the program has finished executing.
    A program can contain multiple BEGIN and END blocks. BEGIN blocks are executed in the order they are encountered, while END blocks are executed in reverse order.




************************ MODULES AND MIXINS ************************


Modules are a way of grouping together methods, classes, and constants.
Modules give two major benefits:
    - modules provide a namespace and prevent name clashes
    - modules implement the mixin facility

Syntax:
            module Identifier
                # code...
            end

Module constants are named just like class constants, with an initial uppercase letter.
Module methods are defined just like class methods. Module methods are defined with the module name
and then the dot operator and the method name.

    i.e.
            module ModuleName
                PI = 3.14
                def ModuleName.methodName
                    # code...
                end
                def ModuleName.method2
                    # code...
                end
            end

Require:
    The require statement is similar to the include statement in C/C++ and the import statement in
    Java. If a third program wants to use any defined module, it can simply load the module files
    using the require statement.

    Syntax:         require "filename"              # note you don't need to give the .rb extension

    To make Ruby aware that included files must be searched in the current directory, use the
    code:           $LOAD_PATH << '.'
    Or instead of using the $LOAD_PATH variable you can use "require_relative" to include files from
    a relative directory.


Include:
    With the include statement you can embed a module in a class.

    Syntax:         include modulename

    If a module is defined in a separate file then you must use the require statement to get at the
    file it is in, before using the include statement to identify the specific module in that file
    to embed in a class.

    You can define new variables and methods to act locally on the module in your class.
    When accessing variables or constants from a module in your embedded module in the class, make
    sure to use the :: operator to get access to them.

    i.e.
            $LOAD_PATH << '.'
            require "filename"

            class MyClass
                include modulename
                    # can make new variables and methods to use with the module here
                end
                # code...
            end

    Or to just simply include the module without adding any extra stuff to it in the class just
    use:    include modulename

    To call a method or variable from an embedded module in a class just use the normal way to use
    a property of a class:
                                objName.property


Mixins:
    When a class can inherit from more than one parent, the class has multiple inheritance.
    Ruby does not support multiple inheritance directly, but Ruby Modules can basically take the
    place of multiple inheritance using a facility called a mixin.
    Mixins give a controlled way of adding functionality to classes and by providing the equivalent
    of multiple inheritance they give the programmer a lot of power.

    Note that mixin isn't a keyword or anything you put in the code, it is just what using modules
    to give classes multiple inheritance is called. So you don't do anything extra to use mixins,
    you just embed more than one module in a class, and that is a mixin.




************************ STRINGS ************************


You can use either single quotes or double quotes, but they have different meanings.

Expression Substitution:
    A means of embedding the value of any Ruby expression into a string using #{ }. This is how you
    include variables in a string, you don't need to split of the string with +'s or .'s.

    Although when using a variable with a method in a string you must add it to the output string
    with a + sign instead of putting it right in the string, as in most languages.

    When printing out a variable all by itself you can just put the variable name or put it in
    between quotes using the #{ } .

    It looks like in a class you can refer to instance variables without the curly braces and
    instead just do this:           #@varname

General Delimited Strings:
    You can create strings inside a pair of matching but arbitrary delimiter characters, like !, (, {, <, etc. as long as the first delimiter character is preceded by a %.
    Q, q, and x have special meanings, but I think maybe any other character can be used as the
    delimiter.

    i.e.
            %$I like Ruby$
            %{I like Ruby}
            %^I like Ruby^
            %:I like Ruby:
            %5I like Ruby5              # I assume anything will work excapt Q, q, x

    By default I think a double-quoted string is made.
    Q creates a double-quoted string.
    q creates a single-quoted string.
    x I think creates a command out of the string.

    i.e.
            %Q{I like Ruby}         # "I like Ruby"
            %q{I like Ruby}         # a single quoted string
            %x!ls!                  # equivalent to back tick command output 'ls'


Ruby I think has the standard escape characters.

The default encoding set for Ruby is ASCII. To change the encoding set put $KCODE at the beginning
of the program. The codes to set $KCODE equal to are:
        a       -       ASCII (default)
        e       -       EUC
        n       -       none (same as ASCII)
        u       -       UTF-8

    i.e.            $KCODE = 'u'


To create a new string object, rather than a setting a string literal to a variable, do:
        
        myStr = String.new("thestring")

There are a ton of built-in String methods. See them all here:
                            http://www.tutorialspoint.com/ruby/ruby_strings.htm

Some methods:
    gsub(regex,replacement)     -   global substitution. first param is substring to find, second
                                    param is the replacement substring

The unpack(format) String method decodes a string according to the given format, return an array
of each value extracted. The format string consists of a sequence of single-character directives.
To see all the directives check out the webpage mentioned directly above.




************************ ARRAYS ************************


Arrays in Ruby are ordered, integer-indexed collections of any object. Arrays can mix all different
types of objects.
Negative indexes start at the end of the array, so an index of -1 refers to the last element, -2 to
the second to last element, as so on.

Arrays in Ruby grow automatically while adding elements to them.


Creating Arrays:
    There are several ways to create or initialize an array.
            myArr = Array.new
            myArr = Array.new(20)               # sets the size of the array
            myArr = Array.new(4, "todd")        # will create the array with 4 "todd" elements
            myArr = Array.new(5) {|e| e=e*2}    # this would populate the array with what the block
                                                  evaulates to, where the variable between the pipe
                                                  bars represents the index
            myArr = Array[1, "todd", 45]        # creates the array with 1,"todd",45
            myArr = Array.[](1, "todd", 45)     # creates the array with 1,"todd",45
            myArr = Array(5..9)                 # creates the array with 5 through 9
            [1,"blah", 99]                      # creates the array with 1,"blah",99
            [5..9]                              # creates the array with 5 through 9


Returns the size of an array with either the .size or .length methods.

When outputting a whole array like:     puts "#{myArr}"     all the elements will be printed out
one after the other, with on space or commas in-between.

However, you can set an Array value separator, so that arrays won't print out with all the
elements combined in the output. I think the "$," global variable is used for this. Just set it
to whatever string you want to be used to separate the values in an array when it is output.

    i.e.
        $, = ", "        # sets a comma then a space to separate the output of each array element

There are many Array object methods built into Ruby that can be seen on this webpage:
                    http://www.tutorialspoint.com/ruby/ruby_arrays.htm

There is a pack method for the Array object which I guess is the opposite of the String's unpack
method. It takes a bunch of different directives as well, which can be seen on the webpage
referenced just above this.




************************ HASHES ************************


A Hash is a collection of key-value pairs, it's like an array, but the indexing is done with
arbitrary keys of ANY object type, not an integer index.
The order of traversing a has can be by key or value and will generally not be in the insertion
order. Attempting to access an element with a key that doesn't exist will return nil.

You can create a default value for a Hash, which means if you try to access a key that doesn't
exist, instead of returning nil it will return the Hash's default value. The default value can be
set when the Hash is created.

Creating a Hash:
    There are a variety of ways to create hashes.

        hsh = Hash.new                          # creates a hash with a default value of nil
        hsh = Hash.new("value")                 # create hash and gives a default value to the hash
        hsh = Hash.new "value"                  # create hash and gives a default value to the hash
        hsh = Hash["key" => value, ...]         # create a hash and initialize some key-value pairs
        hsh = Hash.new { |hash, key| block}     # create a hash with a block


Built-in Methods:
    There are many built-in methods in Ruby for Hashes. See them here on this webpage:
                        http://www.tutorialspoint.com/ruby/ruby_hashes.htm




************************ DATE AND TIME ************************


The Time class in Ruby represents dates and times. This class may be unable to represent dates
before 1970 or after 2038.

Getting Current Date and Time:
    time1 = Time.new                # creates a new time object
    time2 = Time.now                # creates a new time object, equivalent to Time.new
    puts time1.inspect              # give the time/date in the format:
    puts time2.inspect              #           weekday month day time timezone year
                                    # i.e.  Mon Jun 02 12:23:45 -0700 2014


Getting various components of the date and time:
    time = Time.new

    time.inspect                # current time
    time.year                   # year
    time.month                  # month (1 to 12)
    time.day                    # day (1 to 31)
    time.wday                   # week day (0-6), 0 is Sunday
    time.yday                   # day of year (1-365)
    time.hour                   # 24-hour clock
    time.min                    # minute
    time.sec                    # second
    time.usec                   # microseconds (i.e. 236783)
    time.zone                   # timezone name (i.e. UTC)


Some Useful Time Methods:
    Three methods to format date in standard format:
        Time.local(2014, 3, 20)                         # March 20, 2014
        Time.local(2014, 3, 20, 8, 45)                 # March 20, 2014 08:45am local time
        Time.utc(2014, 3, 20, 8, 45)                   # March 20, 2014 08:45 UTC
        Time.gm(2014, 3, 20, 8, 45, 23)                # March 20, 2014 08:45:23 GMT (same as UTC)

    To get all components in an array in the following format, 
    [sec,min,hour,day,month,year,wday,ydad,isdst,zone].
    Use the "to_a" method to get a time in this format.
                    time1 = Time.new
                    values = time.to_a
    This array cn be passed to Time.utc or Time.local to get a different format for the dates.
        time = Time.new
        value = time.to_a
        puts Time.utc(*values)            # expands the array of values each into their own params

    To get the time as it is represented internally in the computer, since the epoc:
        time = Time.now.to_i                # returns seconds since the epoch
        Time.at(time)                       # converts number of seconds into Time object
        time = Time.now.to_f                # returns seconds sinc epoch, including milliseconds


Getting info related to timezones and daylight savings:
    time = Time.new

    time.zone                   # returns the timezone (I think this by default returns UTC)
    time.utc_offset             # timezone offset from UTC in seconds I think (so 0 is UTC)
    time.zone                   # local timezone
    time.isdst                  # false if UTC does not have DST
    time.utc?                   # true if it is in UTC time zone
    time.localtime              # convert to local timezone
    time.gmtime                 # convert back to UTC
    time.getlocal               # return a new Time object in the local timezone
    time.getutc                 # return a new Time object in UTC


Formatting Times and Dates:
    Various ways to do this, one example below.

        i.e.    time = Time.new
                puts time.to_s                              # Mon Apr 07 11:34:45 -0700 2014
                puts time.ctime                             # Mon Apr  7 11:34:45 2014
                puts time.localtime                         # Mon Apr 07 11:34:45 -0700 2014
                puts time.strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")     # 2014-04-07 11:34:45


Time Arithmetic:
    You can do simple arithmetic with time.

    i.e.        now = Time.now
                past = now - 10         # 10 seconds ago, past is created now as a Time object
                future = now + 10       # 10 second from now
                diff = future - now     # 10


There are a number of formatting directives used to with the Time.strftime method.
See all the formatting directives on this webpage:
                            http://www.tutorialspoint.com/ruby/ruby_date_time.htm




************************ RANGES ************************


Ruby allows the use of ranges as sequences, conditions, and intervals.

Ranges as Sequences:
    The most natural use of ranges is as a sequence. Sequences have a start point, an end point,
    and a way to produce successive values.
    Sequences are created used the ".." and "..." range operators.
    ".." creates an inclusive range.
    "..." creates a range that excludes only the end point value.

        i.e.        (1..5)          ('a'..'i')      (0...23)        ("bar"..."bat")

    Range objects contain two Fixnum objects. If you need to, you can convert a range to a list
    using the "to_a" method.
                                    i.e.        range1 = (1..10).to_a

    Some methods of Ranges:
        .include?(value)                # returns boolean for if value is in the range
        .min                            # returns the minimum value in the range
        .max                            # returns the maximum value in the range
        .reject { |var| condition }     # returns rejected values, condition given in the block
        .each do |var|                  # iterates through a range


Ranges as Conditions:
    Ranges can be used as conditional expressions.

    In this example, the code gets lines from standard input where the first line in each set
    constains the word "start" and the last line in each set contains the word "end":

            while gets
                print if /start/../end/
            end

    Ranges an also be used as statements, like in a Case conditional:

            case blah
                when 0..10: "yo"
                when 11..20: "yowzer"
                when 21..30: "whatevs"
                else "bloop"
            end


Ranges as Intervals:
    Ranges can be used as an interval test, which means seeing of some value falls within the
    interval represented by the range. This is done using the === case-equality operator.

    i.e.        if ((1..10) ===5)
                    # code...
                end




************************ ITERATORS ************************


Iterators are just methods supported by Collections. Collections are objects that store a group
of data members. In ruby, arrays and hashes are collections.

Iterators return all the elements of a collection, one after the other.
A couple good Ruby iterators are "each" and "collect".


Each:
    The "each" iterator returns all the elements of an array or has. The "each" iterator always
    has a block of code associated with it to execute, with a variable that gets each element of
    the collection.

    Syntax:     collection.each do |var|
                    # code...
                end


Collect:
    The "collect" iterator returns all elements of a collection. The "collector" iterator does not
    need to be associated with a block of code.
    The collect method returns the entire collection.

    Syntax:     collection = collection.collect             # returns all values of the collection




************************ I/O ************************


puts:
    Prints to STDOUT, adding a newline at the end of the output.
        Syntax:     puts "string #{var}"            puts var        puts var.method

gets:
    Takes any input fromthe user from STDIN. Adds a newline to the end of the input.
        Syntax:     var = gets          var = gets.chomp

putc:
    Prints one character at a time to STDOUT.
        Syntax:     putc string

print:
    Prints to STDOUT, same as puts except doesn't add a newline at the end of the output.
        Syntax: print "string #{var}"




************************ FILES ************************


Opening and Closing Files:
    Create a new file object using File.new method for reading, writing, or both, according to the
    mode of the string. Use File.close method to close the file.

    Syntax:     aFile = File.new("filename", "mode")
                # code to process file...
                aFile.close

    Another way to open a file is to use the File.open method. This creates a new file object and
    assigns it to a file, just like the File.new method does, except the File.open method can be
    associated with a block, while File.new cannot. See the syntax below for some idea of how this
    works.

    Syntax:     File.open("filename", "mode") do |aFile|
                    # code to process file...
                aFile.close

    Modes for opening a file:
        r       read-only mode, file pointer is placed at beginning of file. (default)
        r+      read-write mode, file pointer is placed at beginning of file.
        w       write-only mode, overwrites the file if the file exists, otherwise creates new file.
        w+      read-write mode, overwrites the file if the file exists, otherwise creates new file.
        a       write-only mode, file pointer is placed at end of file if the file exists, and it
                appends onto the end of the file. If file doesn't exist, creates new file.
        a+      read-write mode, file point is placed at end of file if the file exists, the file
                opens in the append mode. If file doesn't exist, creates a new file.

    Check to see if the fileObj successfully opened the file by doing:          if fileOjb


Reading and Writing to Files:
    The same I/O methods used for standard I/O can be used for files.
    So fileObj.gets reads a line from the file object.
    But there are other file specific methods to use as well.

    sysread:
        Read the contents of a file. Can be used no matter what mode was used to open the file.
        Syntax:     var = aFile.sysread(charNum)

        The argument is the number of characters to read, after which the file pointer will point to
        the next character.

    syswrite:
        Used to write contents into a file. Need to open the file in write mode in order to use
        syswrite.
        Syntax:     aFile.syswrite("string")

    each_byte:
        This method belongs to the File class. The each_byte method is always associated with a block. The method just gets characters from the file one by one, so you can put each
        character in a varaible in the block like shown in the example below.
            i.e.         aFile.each_byte { |ch| putc ch; putc ?. }

    IO.readlines:
        The class File is a subclass of the class IO. The class IO also has some methods that can
        be used to manipulate files.
        The IO.readlines method returns the contents of the file line by line, and returns an array
        of all the lines from the file.
            Syntax:     myArr = IO.readlines("filename")

    IO.foreach:
        This method returns the file contents line by line. Difference between this and readlines
        is that the foreach method must be associated with a block, and also the for-each method
        does not return an array because the block simply does processing on all the lines.
            Syntax:     IO.foreach("filename") {|var| #code for each line... }


Renaming and Deleting Files:
    Use the rename and delete methods to rename and delete files.
        Syntax:     File.rename("currentFilename", "newFilename")
        Syntax:     File.delete("filename")


Files Modes and Ownership
    Use the chmod method with a mask to change the mode or permissions of a file.
        Syntax:     aFile.chmod(0755)
    See the following webpage for a list of all masks/arguments for the chmod method:
                                    http://www.tutorialspoint.com/ruby/ruby_input_output.htm


File Inquiries
    Test if a file exists before opening it:
                File.open("filename") if File::exists?("filename")
    
    Test if a file is really a file:
                File.file?("filename")

    Find out if file name is a directory:
                File::directory?("filename")

    Test if file is readable, writable, or executable:
                File.readable?("filename")
                File.writable?("filename")
                File.executable?("filename")

    Tests whether the file has zero size or not:
                File.zero?("filename")

    Return the size of the file:
                File.size?("filename")

    Find out the type of the file, returns either file, directory, characterSpecial, blockSpecial,
    fifo, link, socket, or unknown:
                File::ftype("filename")

    Find when a file was created, modified, or last accessed:
                File::ctime("filename")
                File::mtime("filename")
                File::atime("filename")


Directories:
    Directories are handled in Ruby with the "Dir" class.

    Navigating through Directories:
        To change directory within a Ruby program:
                Dir.chdir("pathToNewDirectory")

        Find out what the current directory is:
                Dir.pwd

        Get a list of the files and directories with a specific directory, this returns an array
        with all the entires in the specified directory.:
                Dir.entries("filepath").join(' ')

        The Dir.foreach method does the same thing as Dir.entries:
                Dir.foreach("filepath") do |entry|
                    puts entry
                end

        An even more precise way of getting directory listings is by using the Dir class' array
        method:
                Dir["filepath"]


    Creating a Directory:
        The Dir.mkdir method is used to create directories.
                Dir.mkdir("dirName")
                Dir.mkdir("dirName", 755)       # can set permission on the directory


    Deleting a Directory:
        The Dir.delete method is used to delete a directory. The Dir.unlink and Dir.rmdir methods
        do the exact same thing too.
                Dir.delete("dirName")
                Dir.unlink("dirName")
                Dir.rmdir("dirName")


    Creating Files and Temporary Directories:
        Temporary files are those that might be created briefly during a program's execution but
        aren't a permanent store of information.
        Dir.tmpdir provides the path to the temporary directory on the current system. But this
        method is not available by default. To make Dir.tmpdir available you have to require tmpdir.
        You can use Dir.tmpdir and File.join to create a platform-indpendent temporary file.
        The following shows how to create a temporary file, write data to it, and delete it.
                require 'tmpdir'
                tempFileName = File.join(Dir.tmpdir, "filenameToCreate")
                tempfile = File.new(tempFileName, "w")
                tempfile.puts "This is a temp file"
                tempfile.close
                File.delete(tempfilename)

        Ruby's standard library also includes a library called Tempfile that can create temporary
        files:
                require 'tempfile'
                f = Tempfile.new("filename")
                f.puts "eh yo"
                puts f.path
                f.close

************************ EXCEPTIONS ************************


Exceptions are used in places where an error may occur so that instead of the program stopping you
can program in something code to handle the error.

In Ruby, you enclose the code that could raise an exception in a begin/end block and use rescue
clauses to tell Ruby the types of exceptions you want to handle.

    Syntax:
            begin
                # code that might cause an error
            rescue OneTypeOfException
                # handle the exception
            rescue AnotherTypeOfException
                # handle the exception
            else
                # other exceptions
            ensure
                # always will be executed
            end

Everything between beging and rescue is protected, so if an exception occurs then control is passed
to the block between rescue and end.
For each rescue clause Ruby compares the raised Exception against each of the parameters in turn.
The match will succeed if the exception named in the rescue clause is the same as the type of the
currently thrown exception, or is a superclass of that exception.
The else if used in the event that an exception does not match any of the error types specified.

retry:
    You can capture an exception using a rescue block and then use the retry keyword to execute
    the begin block from the beginning again.
    Be careful when using "retry" so that you don't end up in an infinite loop.

    Syntax:         begin
                        #code...
                    rescue
                        #code...
                        retry
                    end

raise:
    You can use the raise statement to raise an exception (or a Runtime error if there is no current
    exception). This is used in exception handlers that need to intercept an exception before
    passing it on.

    Syntax:         raise
            or
                    raise "Error message"
            or
                    raise ExceptionType, "Error message"
            or
                    raise ExceptionType, "Error message" condition

    The raise keyword an exception whenever it is called. The error message will be printed.

ensure:
    The ensure keyword is used to guarantee that some processing is done at the end of the block of
    code, regardless of whether an exception was raised. An ensure clause goes after the last
    rescue clause.

else:
    If there is an else clause used, it goes after the rescue clauses and before any ensure clause.
    The body of the else clause is executed only if no exceptions are raised.

Catch and Throw:
    Catch and throw allows you to jump out of some deeply nested construct during normal
    processing. The catch defines a block that is labeled with a given name. The block is executed
    normally until a throw in encountered.

    Syntax:     throw :labelname
                    # this will not be executed...
                catch :labelname do
                    # matching catch will be executed after a throw is encountered
                end

            or

                throw: labelname condition
                    # this will not be executed...
                catch :labelname do
                    # matching catch will be exectuted after a throw is encountered
                end

    So a throw block's label refers to a catch block's label, and the catch block's code will be
    run if the throw condition is met.... something like this.


Class Exception:
    Ruby's standard classes and modules raise exceptions. All the exception classes form a
    hierarchy, with the class Exception at the top. The next level contains seven different types:
            Interrupt
            NoMemoryError
            SignalException
            ScriptError
            StandardError
            SystemExit

    If you create your own exception classes, they need to be subclasses of either class Exception
    or one of its descendents.
        i.e.
                class FileSaveError < StandardError
    I dunno, will have to look into exceptions more at some point.




************************ OOP ************************


Creating a class:
    Syntax:         class ClassName
                        # code...
                    end


Creating an object:
    Syntax:         objName = ClassName.new


The Initialize Method:
    This method is a standard Ruby class method and is I think the same as constructors in other
    languages.

    Syntax:     class ClassName
                    def initialize(params)
                        @code...
                    end
                end


Instance Variables:
    Instance variables are the member variables of an object. They are references within the class
    using the @ operator, but outside the class they must be accessed via public accessor methods.


Accessor and Setter Methods:
    Used same way as any other language.
    Except you can use setter methods in the following way so that it looks just like directly
    assigning a value to a member variable, but it is in fact a member method.

    Syntax:     def setter=(value)
                    @var = value
                end

                objName.setter = value


Instance Methods:
    There are just normal member methods, defined and called the same way as any method.


Class Methods and Variables:
    Class variables are shared among all instances of a class, they are used with @@ as a prefix.
    A class variable must be initialized within the class definition, not in a constructor.
        i.e.        class ClassName
                        @@someVar = value

    A class method is defined using "def self.methodname()" which ends as normal with the "end"
    keyword.  These are methods for the whole class, not each object, and so I guess should deal
    with class variables only I'm assuming. To call a class method you use the class name, not an
    object name.

        i.e.        def self.methodname()
                        # code...
                    end

                    ClassName.methodname()


to_s:
    Any class you define should have a to_s method to return a string representation of the object.
        i.e.
                def to_s
                    "string to display"

                puts "#{objName}"           # outputs: "string to display"


Access Control:
    Ruby has three levels of protection for instance methods: public, private, protected.
    Ruby does not apply any access control over instance and class variables.

    Public Methods  -   can be called by anyone. Methods are public by defualt except for
                        initialize, which is always private
    Private Methods -   cannot be accessed or viewed from outside the class. Only the class methods
                        can access private members.
    Protected Methods - can be invoked only by objects of the defining class and its subclasses.
                        Access is kept within the family.

    To make instance methods private or protected, in the class definition do this (might have to
    be done after the method has been defined in the class definition):

        Syntax:     private :methodName, :methodName
                    protected :methodname


Class Inheritance:
    Ruby supports single inheritance but not multiple inheritance, however mixins can be used as a
    an equivalent of multiple inheritance in which only the interface portion is inherited.

    To extend a class to inherit a superclass just use the < character in the class definition
    after the class name and before the parent class name.

    Syntax:         class className < superClassName


Method Overriding:
    Changes the functionality in a derived class of a method from a superclass.
    All you do is make a new definition of the method in the derived class.


Operator Overloading:
    To make an operator (like say the + operator) perform some operation with objects of that
    class.

    i.e.
        class MyClass
            # define + to add values between this object and "other" object and make a new object
            def -(other)
                MyClass.new( #values to subtract in a new object constructor# )
            end
            
            # define negative sign to negate values and make a new object
            def -@
                MyClass.new( #value to negate in a new object constructor# )
            end

            # define scalar multiplication and create new object with multiplied values
            def *(scalar)
                MyClass.new( @blah*scalar )
            end


Freezing Objects:
    Using the freeze method (I guess a built-in method for all objects) to prevent an object from
    being changed, basically turning it into a constant object.
    
        Syntax:         object.freeze

    To check whether an object is already frozen use the frozen? method, which returns true if
    object is frozen, false otherwise.

        Syntax:         object.frozen?


Class Constants:
    To define a constant inside a class assign a literal value to a variable without using the @ or
    @@ symbols. By convention constants are uppercase.

    To access a class constant outside a class you must use the following syntax:
                className::constant


Create object using allocate:
    To create an uninitialized object (creating an object without the "new" method, and therefore
    without the initialize() constructor) use the "allocate" method.

        Syntax:         objName = className.allocate


Class Information:
    Class definitions execute in the context of some object, which means self must reference
    something. A class definition is executed with that class as the current object.
    Typing self.type would return Class, and typing self.name would return the class name.
