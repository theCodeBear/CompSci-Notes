Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX) Notes



AJAX is not a programming language, but a different way to use existing standards.
AJAX lets you exchange data with the server and update parts of the webpage without reloading the
whole page.
AJAX can help create faster web pages.

AJAX updates webpages asynchronously by exchanging small amounts of data with the server behind the
scenes. Classic web pages that do not use AJAX must reload the whole page to change content.

Google maps, Gmail, Youtube, and Facebook tabs are examples of applications that use AJAX.




************************ AJAX BASICS ************************


Browser:                                                Server:
An event occurs...
-create an XMLHttpRequest object        ---->           -process HttpRequest
-send HttpRequest                                       -create a response and send data back
                                                         to browser
                                                          |
                                                          |
                        Browser:                          |
                        -process the returned data    <---|
                         using JavaScript
                        -update page content


AJAX is based on internet standards and uses a combination of:
    - XMLHttpRequest object     (to exchange data asynchornously with a server)
    - JavaScript/DOM        (to display/interact with the information)
    - CSS       (to style the data)
    - XML       (often used as the format for transferring data)

AJAX applications are browser and platform independent.

Note that AJAX uses JavaScript to do the actual coding.




************************ XMLHttpRequest Object ************************


The keystone of AJAX is the XMLHttpRequest object.


Create an XMLHttpRequest Object:

    In modern browsers:
        variable = new XMLHttpRequest();

    In IE5 and IE6:
        variable = new ActiveXObject("Microsoft.XMLHTTP");

    i.e.
            var xmlhttp;
            if (window.XMLHttpRequest)
                xmlhttp = new XMLHttpRequest();
            else
                xmlhttp = new ActiveXObject("Microsoft.XMLHTTP");


--------------------


Send a Request to a Server:

    Methods to use on the Request object:

        open(method, url, async)    -   specifies the type of request, the url, and if the request
                                        should be handled asyncrhonously or not
                                                method: GET or POST
                                                url: location of the file on the server
                                                async: true (asynchronous) or false (synchronous)
        send(string)                -   Sends the request off to the server.
                                                string: only used for POST requests

        i.e.
            xmlhttp.open("GET", "filename", true);
            xmlhttp.send();


    GET or POST?
            GET is simpler and faster and can be used in most cases.
            Always use POST when:
                - a cached file is not an otion (update a file or database on the server)
                - sending a large amount of data to the server (POST has no size limitations)
                - sending user input (which can have malicious code, POST is more secure than GET)

    GET Requests:
        A normal GET request might get a cached result, so to avoid this you can add a unique ID
        to the URL using Math.random() like so:
                xmlhttp.open("GET" "filename" + Math.random(), true);   // ?? need to look this up
                xmlhttp.send();

        Can also send information with the GET method by adding it to the URL:
                xmlhttp.open("GET" "filenamefname=Henry&lname=Ford", true);     // ?? look this up
                xmlhttp.send();

    POST Requests:
                xmlhttp.open("POST","filename",true);
                xmlhttp.send();

        To POST data like an HTML form, add an HTTP header with setRequestHeader(). Specify the
        data you want to send in the send() method:

        Syntax:         setRequestHeader(header,value)      -   Adds HTTP header to the request
                                                                    header: specifies header name
                                                                    value: specifies header value
                xmlhttp.open("POST", filename, true);
                xmlhttp.setRequestHeader("Content-type", "application/x-www-form-urlencoded");
                xmlhttp.send("fname=Henry&lname=Ford");

    Setting the third open() parameter to true means making an asynchronous request, which is a
    huge improvement for web pages because it means the processing can take place in the
    background instead of holding up the webpage.
    If you set it to false, the JavaScript will not continue until the server response is ready.
    If false, don't write an onreadystatechange() function, discussed below.


--------------------


Server Response

    To get the response from a server, use the responseText or responseXML property of the
    XMLHttpRequest object.

    responseText    -   get the response data as a string
        If the response from the server is not XML, use the responseText property.
        i.e.
            document.getElementById("myDiv").innerHTML = xmlhttp.responseText;    

    responseXML     -   get the response data as XML data
        If response from the server is XML, and you want to parse it as an XML object, use this.
        i.e.
            xmlDoc=xmlhttp.responseXML;
            txt="";
            x=xmlDoc.getElementsByTagName("blah");
            for (i=0; i<x.length; i++)
                txt += x[i].childNodes[0].nodeValue + "<br>";
            document.getElementById("myDiv").innerHTML=txt;


    ResponseText equals whatever is printed out from the PHP file that was called in the AJAX.
    So you don't return anything from the PHP script, you just echo something to return it to
    responseText.

--------------------


onreadystatechange Event

    When a request to a server is sent, we want to perform some actions based on the response.
    The onreadystatechange event is triggered every time the readyState changes.
    The readyState property holds the status of the XMLHttpRequest.

    Important properties of the XMLHttpRequest object:
        onreadystatechange  -   stores a function (or name of a function) to be called automatically
                                each time the readyState property changes
        readyState          -   Holds the status of the XMLHttpRequest. Changes from 0 to 4:
                                    0: request not initialized
                                    1: server connection established
                                    2: request received
                                    3: processing request
                                    4: request finished and response is ready
        status              -   200: "OK"
                                400: Page not found

    In the onreadystatechange event you specify what will happen when the server response is ready
    to be processed. When readyState is 4 and status is 200, the response is ready.

    i.e.    xmlhttp.onreadystatechange=function() {
                if (xmlhttp.readyState == 4 && xmlhttp.status == 200)
                    document.getElementById("myDiv").innerHTML = xmlhttp.responseText;
            }

    Using a Callback function:

        A callback function is a function passed as a parameter to another function.
        If you have more than one AJAX task on the website, you should create ONE standard function
        for creating the XMLHttpRequest object, and call this for each AJAX task.

        The function call should contain the URL and what to do on the onreadystatechange (which
        is probably different for each call):

        i.e.    function myFunc() {
                    loadXMLDoc("filename", function() {
                        if (xmlhttp.readyState==4 && status==200)
                            document.getElementById("myDiv").innerHTML=xmlhttp.responseText;
                    });
                }

    AJAX can be used for interactive communication with an XML file. This is what I did for my
    Resume on my website. An example:       http://www.w3schools.com/ajax/ajax_xmlfile.asp
