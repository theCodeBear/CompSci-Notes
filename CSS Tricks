CSS Tricks

To make the entire box-area around a link clickable, like in a navigation menu, instead of just the text being clickable:
    Make the <a> display: block, and don't put padding in the <li> selector, instead put padding in the <a>
    so that it will take up the whole <li> area.

To change the font-size of a Submit button apparently you have to change the background-color of it too, otherwise the
font size won't change! Bizarre!


In order to get the cells of a table to to fit onto the screen or whatever width dimension you want, without having the table go off the screen to the right, just use "table-layout: fixed; word-wrap: break-word" like the following css to the table element:
    width: 100%;          // or whatever you want to set it at
    table-layout: fixed;
    word-wrap: break-word;
Now your table's cells will all shrink to fit the width you gave the table.
